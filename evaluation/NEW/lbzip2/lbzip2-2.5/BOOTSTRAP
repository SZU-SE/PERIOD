The code repository doesn't contain any auto-generated files or files
imported from Gnulib, which are needed to build lbzip2 and which can be
found in distribution tarballs.  In order to build lbzip2 from repository
these files must be generated first (the process is called bootstrapping).

To bootstrap lbzip2 you need:
 * perl
 * Gnulib
 * Autoconf 2.63 or newer
 * Automake 1.14 or newer

To bootstrap lbzip2 simply run `./build-aux/autogen.sh' from top source
directory.  gnulib-tool as well as perl, autoconf, autoheader, automake,
and aclocal must be in PATH.

To reverse the bootstrapping process (i.e. to remove auto-generated files
and files imported from Gnulib) you can run `./build-aux/autogen.sh -r'.
Be aware that this command may remove whole subdirectories if they are
meant to hold only auto-generated files (lib, m4, build-aux/snippet).
