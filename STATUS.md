### Apply for the Functional, Reusable, and Available Badges 
 
We are applying the functional, reusable, and available badges for the following reason.
- we have made our prototype tool available via Github; we placed it on the publicly accessible archival repository.
- we carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing are facilitated.
- we have provided three ways to build and run our artifact:
    - (i) we provide a pre-built docker image that containing our prototype tool, all the benchmark programs, and our scripts, which should work out-of-the-box;
    - (ii) we provide instructions to automatically configure the environment and build our tool inside your local docker container.
    - (iii) We also provide instructions to build our prototype tool in your local environment, from source code step by step. This makes it convenient for the second development.
- In particular, we also made our experimental benchmark available and provided some shell scripts to automatically build and perform controlled concurrency testing on the benchmark programs. This should allow you to reproduce our experimental evaluation.
