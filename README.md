# PERIOD: Controlled Concurrency Testing via Periodical Scheduling

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/xiaocong/uiautomator.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

PERIOD is a controlled concurrency testing tool, where a scheduler explores the space of possible interleavings of a concurrent program looking for bugs.

This repository provides the tool and the evaluation subjects for the paper "Controlled Concurrency Testing via Periodical Scheduling'' accepted for the technical track at ICSE 2022. A preprint of the paper can be found at [ICSE2022_PERIOD.pdf](https://wcventure.github.io/pdf/ICSE2022_PERIOD.pdf).

## Directory Structure

The repository mainly contains three folders: [*tool*](#tool), [*test*](#test) and [*evaluation*](#evaluation). We briefly introduce each folder under `/workdir/PERIOD` (if you install by using docker, the root folder of the artifact would be `/workdir/PERIOD`):
- `clang+llvm`: Pre-Built Binaries of LLVM 10.0. These binaries include Clang, LLD, compiler-rt, various LLVM tools, etc.
- `tools`: Root directory for PERIOD tool and scripts.
  - `DBDS`: The code about our proposed periodical scheduling method that can systematically explore the thread interleaving.
  - `staticanalysis`: The scripts of static analysis, which aim to find key points that used to be scheduled during testing. It also contains the codes about instrumentation.
  - `SVF`: Third-party libraries project SVF, which provides interprocedural dependence analysis for LLVM-based languages. SVF is able to perform pointer alias analysis, memory SSA form construction, value-flow tracking for program variables. 
  - `wllvm`: Third-party libraries project WLLVM, which provides tools for building whole-program (or whole-library) LLVM bitcode files from an unmodified C or C++ source package.
- `test`: Some simple examples that are easy to understand. These examples could also be used to check the installation.
- `evaluation`: Root for benchmark directories. The ConVul-CVE-Benchmarks correspond to the 10 programs used in Table. 1 in our paper. Other folders contain the 36 programs used in Table. 2 in our paper. We provide scripts for each program for easy installation.
  - `ConVul-CVE-Benchmarks`: 10 programs correspond to a real-world CVE.
  - `CB`: Test cases for real applications.
  - `CS`: Small test cases and some small programs.
  - `Chess`: Test cases for several versions of a work-stealing queue.
  - `Inspect_benchmarks`: Small test cases and some small programs.
  - `RADBench`: Tests cases for real applications.
  - `SafeStack`: Test case for lock-free stack and a debugging library test case.
  - `Splash2`: Parallel workloads.

## Tool

The easiest way to use PERIOD is to use Docker. We strongly recommend installing and running our tool based on Docker. If you really want to install the tool in your host system, please see [INSTALL.md](tool/INSTALL.md) for more detail.

### Requirements

- **Hardware Requirements:** Please use workstations/PC with multi-core processors, as PERIOD is a concurrency testing tool
- **Operating System:** >= Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Requires kernel version >= 4.x due to the scheduling policy)
- **Docker**: The only requirement is to install Docker (version higher than 18.09.7). You can use the command `sudo apt-get install docker.io` to install the docker on your Linux machine. (If you have any questions on docker, you can see [Docker's Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)).

### Installing

- **Add `period:latest` image on your system**. There are two ways of doing this:
  - `docker pull wcventure/period:stable && docker tag wcventure/period:stable period:latest`
  - Alternatively, you can build your own image with `sudo docker build -t period:latest --no-cache ./`

### Running on Docker

- **Running a privileged container**
  - `sudo docker run --privileged -it period:latest /bin/bash`
  - Then you will start a docker container and enter the configured environment of PERIOD.

----------

## Test

Before you use PERIOD, we suggest that you first use those simple examples provided by us to confirm whether the tool can work normally. In the following, we use the examples in the `test` folder to explain how to use the tool.

You can use one of the programs in the `test` folder to check whether PERIOD works normally. Take [`doubleFree`](test/doubleFree/df.c) as a running example. Here, let's run it with a prepared script (If you want to try a program outside the folder `test` and `evaluation`, please refer to [Advance Usage](AdvancUsage.md).).

1. Enter the working directory:
    ```sh
    cd /workdir/PERIOD/test/doubleFree
    ```

2. Use the following script to build the program:
   ```sh
   ./cleanDIR.sh && ./build.sh
   ```

3. Perform systematic controlled concurrency testing based on periodical scheduling:
    ```sh
    $ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py -y -d 3 ./df
    ```

4. If PERIOD works normally, you can see the following outputs, which indicate that PERIOD reports 2 buggy interleavings in this program (i.e., double free bugs):
    ```sh
    Start Testing!
    Targeting bugs that bug depth = 1 . Iterate for 2 periods
    test 0001: [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
    test 0002: [[1, 1], [0, 0]]
    Targeting bugs that bug depth = 2 . Iterate for 3 periods
    test 0003: [[0], [1, 1], [0]]
            [Error Found]: NO.1 double-free
            The interleavings saved in out_df_1/Errors/000001_0000003_double-free
    test 0004: [[1], [0, 0], [1]]
            [Error Found]: NO.2 double-free
            The interleavings saved in out_df_1/Errors/000002_0000004_double-free
    Targeting bugs that bug depth = 3 . Iterate for 4 periods
    test 0005: [[0], [1], [0], [1]]
            [Error Found]: NO.3 double-free
            The interleavings saved in out_df_1/Errors/000003_0000005_double-free
    test 0006: [[1], [0], [1], [0]]
            [Error Found]: NO.4 double-free
            The interleavings saved in out_df_1/Errors/000004_0000006_double-free
    End Testing!
    ```

5. After the testing terminates, you can find the folder out_work_1, which saves the buggy schedule that could deterministically reproduce the bugs. 
    - Use the command like the following to reproduce the double free:
    ```sh
    $ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py -r out_df_1/Errors/000001_0000003_double-free ./df
    ```
    And you will see the double free reported by ASAN:
    ```sh
    ==6742==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: attempting double-free on 0x602000000010 in thread T2:
    NULL 1
        #0 0x4941dd  (/workdir/PERIOD/test/doubleFree/df+0x4941dd)
        #1 0x4c65b1  (/workdir/PERIOD/test/doubleFree/df+0x4c65b1)
        #2 0x7f9f056bc6da  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0+0x76da)
        #3 0x7f9f0469a71e  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x12171e)
    ...
    SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: double-free (/workdir/PERIOD/test/doubleFree/df+0x4941dd)
    ==6742==ABORTING
    ```

6. If the above steps can be executed normally, it means that your installation has been successfulÔºÅYou can continue to try other examples in the `test` folder. There are a list of simple examples that are easy to understand in the `test` folder:
   - [UAF](test/UAF)
   - [doubleFree](test/doubleFree)
   - [doubleFree2](test/doubleFree2)
   - [increase_double](test/increase_double)
   - [issue205](test/issue205)
   - [lock](test/lock)
   - [null_concurrency_race](test/null_concurrency_race)
   - [test](test/test)
   - [transfer](test/transfer)
   - [work](test/work)

## Evaluation

The fold evaluation contains all our evaluation subjects. After having PERIOD installed, you can run the scripts `./build.sh` to automatically build the benchmark program with PERIOD instrumentation. Then run the script `$ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py` to perform systematic controlled concurrency testing based on periodical scheduling, with the command `$ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py -d <periods limits> -t <timeout> <program under test> <args>`. 

We take the `CVE-2016-7911` in CVE-Benchmark as an example here.
1. Build Benchmark Program
```sh
cd /workdir/PERIOD/evaluation/ConVul-CVE-Benchmarks/CVE-2016-7911
./cleanDIR.sh
./build.sh
```

2. Expose Bugs with PERIOD
```sh
$ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py -d 3 ./2016-7911
```

3. You may see the following output, which means that we found 8 buggy interleavings related to SEGV (the 3rd tested interleaving found the first SEGV bug).
```sh

End Testing!


Total Error Interleavings: 8
Total Timeouts Interleavings: 0
```

4. Deterministically Reproduce the Bug
```sh
$ROOT_DIR/tool/DBDS/run_PDS.py -r out_2016-7911_1/Errors/000001_0000003_SEGV ./2016-7911
```
You can see a SEVG dump by ASAN:
```sh
==1592==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000004 (pc 0x0000004de9cf bp 0x000000000000 sp 0x7fab08670e50 T1)
