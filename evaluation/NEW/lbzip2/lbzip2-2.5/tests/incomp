# A script that generates incomp-[12].bz2 files.

# It's commonly believed that bzip2 always creates bit-identical compressed
# files for given input file, provided that the block size used is the same.
#
# In fact that's not true. Output file can be different because the Reversible
# Transformation (aka BWT) is sometimes ambiguous. In some cases for given
# input string it's possible to construct two or more different transforms.
#
# The simplest case is a string consisting of two identical characters, for
# instance AA. There exist exactly 2 transformates for this string, namely
# AA with bwt_idx=0 and AA with bwt_idx=1.
#
# bzip2 uses two different algorithms for block-sorting, both of them can
# produce different transformates for the same input, resulting in slightly
# different resulting .bz2 files. The direct reason for that is usage of
# non-stable sorting algorithms, namely shellsort and quicksort.

# The following code first creates input string that has exactly 10 different
# transforms. Then it's compressed with different work factors. The two
# resulting .bz2 files are different (at least for bzip2 1.0.6 and 1.0.5).
